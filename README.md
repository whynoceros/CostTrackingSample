# CostTrackingSample
This is a small code sample from a very large cost tracking app (about 110,000 lines). The files contained are notintended to be run in isolation and are only meant to shed light on my coding style and the types of functionalities core to the app, though there were many more, not shown here. Note that some older syntax is used as the code was written some time ago.
